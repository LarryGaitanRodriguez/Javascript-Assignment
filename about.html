                <h1>We like to say that we're Local and Connected</h1>
                <p> Founded in 2021 as a mock page for UNG's CSCI 3000 Web development course, Lake Lanier Web Development has provided ZERO local businesses in the north Georgia area with high-quality, modern websites.
                    We've built simple HTML-CSS pages, portfolios, and copy-cats of other web pages. Therefore we are confident that we here at LLWEBDEV can provide your brand or local business with a high-quality, modern website too.
                </p>
                <h1>Where did we come from?</h1>
                <p>
                    The founder and single employee of Lake Lanier Web Development is a university student at the University of North Georgia. UNG is located in Dahlonega, Georgia, around 50ish miles north of Atlanta, GA.
                    The company was a result of a project. The company came about due to the owner being really meta with one of his assignments. eventually they became too invested into the idea
                    and decided to take a risk and create the company. They established it September 15th, 2021.
                </p>
                <h1>Whats the pricing?</h1>
                <P>
                    We are willing to take exposure as payment, just like our artist/creator counterparts do (sadly). However, if your business is seriously considering our consulting our services, 
                    we recommend to just go to weebly and make a website there.
                </P>
